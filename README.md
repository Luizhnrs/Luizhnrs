## 📚 About Me
 I started my journey in digital marketing, where, from 2019 to 2022, I helped companies grow with result-focused digital strategies. This gave me a strategic vision that, over time, led me to programming – which started as a hobby and turned into a passion. Today, I'm in my second semester of Information Systems and currently seeking a backend development internship. I have experience with Java, Python, and C#, as well as SQL and NoSQL, and I use tools like Docker and Postman to optimize processes. I'm ready to take on challenges and contribute with innovative solutions in the tech field!
